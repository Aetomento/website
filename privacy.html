	<h2 class="textCenter">Your lawful rights</h2>
	<div class="privacy__para">
		<p>
			While you have your lawful right to information and correction of personal data, we cannot comply with requests for this as we
			do not handle any data ourselves. Similarly, third party services do not provide any unique identifiers to tie data to users.

		<br>
		<p>
			Furthermore, as per GDPR &#167;77, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you conclude
			that the processing of your personal data does not go accordingly to the GDPR and may therefore be illicit.

			Agreement to this policy is permitted only if you are at least 16 years old, or otherwise the regulatory age of your country.
			If you are below the regulatory age, a parent or legal guardian may consent to this policy in your name.
